# Feature Specification: [FEATURE NAME]

**Feature Branch**: `[###-feature-name]`  
**Created**: [DATE]  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "$ARGUMENTS"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

Additional mandatory guidance: Every spec MUST include explicit UX Acceptance Criteria (if feature is user-facing) and Performance Targets (if feature impacts latency/throughput/resource usage). When these sections are not applicable, state `N/A` with rationale.
Security is first-class: Every spec MUST include a Security Considerations section. When decentralized distribution or blockchain elements apply, explicitly mark applicability and include the required details in their sections below.

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")
 
**Mandatory sections updated for constitution alignment**:
- User Scenarios & Testing (mandatory)
- Requirements (mandatory) ‚Äî all FRs MUST be testable and measurable
- UX Acceptance Criteria (mandatory if user-facing)
- Performance Targets (mandatory if feature has performance impact)
- Security Considerations (mandatory)
- Decentralized Distribution / Blockchain Applicability (conditional)

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
[Describe the main user journey in plain language]

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]
2. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]

### Edge Cases
- What happens when [boundary condition]?
- How does system handle [error scenario]?

### UX Acceptance Criteria (if applicable)
- Visual expectations: [screens, components, states]
- Accessibility requirements: keyboard nav, ARIA roles, color contrast
- Success metrics: conversion, error rate, response time targets

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST [specific capability, e.g., "allow users to create accounts"]
- **FR-002**: System MUST [specific capability, e.g., "validate email addresses"]  
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to [key interaction, e.g., "reset their password"]
- **FR-004**: System MUST [data requirement, e.g., "persist user preferences"]
- **FR-005**: System MUST [behavior, e.g., "log all security events"]

*Example of marking unclear requirements:*
- **FR-006**: System MUST authenticate users via [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: auth method not specified - email/password, SSO, OAuth?]
- **FR-007**: System MUST retain user data for [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: retention period not specified]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **[Entity 1]**: [What it represents, key attributes without implementation]
- **[Entity 2]**: [What it represents, relationships to other entities]

## Security Considerations *(mandatory)*
- Threat model summary: [assets, actors, entry points]
- Sensitive data handling: [PII/keys/secrets storage, encryption at rest/in transit]
- Secrets management: [where stored, rotation policy]
- Dependency and supply chain risks: [notable libs, native code, crypto]
- Abuse/misuse cases and mitigations

## Decentralized Distribution / Blockchain Applicability *(conditional)*
If the feature uses decentralized distribution or blockchain, specify:
- Distribution topology and trust model: [P2P/federated/content-addressed]
- Artifact signing and reproducible builds: [signing scheme, verification]
- Upgrade/migration strategy
- On-chain vs off-chain responsibilities
- Gas/fee impact and constraints (if on-chain)
- Audit requirements and status (if smart contracts)

If not applicable, state: `N/A` with a brief rationale.

## Performance Targets (if applicable)
- Declare measurable targets (latency p50/p95/p99, throughput, memory/CPU budgets)
- List performance test(s) that will validate targets and where they will run (CI, staging)
