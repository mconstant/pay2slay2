# Research: Non-Dry Run Testing Environment

## Overview
Research findings for implementing a complete testing environment with live integrations, real-time monitoring, and collaborative feedback mechanisms.

## Technology Decisions

### Integration Testing Framework
**Decision**: Custom FastAPI testing endpoints with httpx for external service calls  
**Rationale**: 
- Leverages existing FastAPI infrastructure 
- httpx provides async HTTP client capabilities for external integrations
- Allows real HTTP calls to external services while maintaining test isolation
**Alternatives considered**: 
- Pytest with mocking (rejected - need real integration testing)
- Separate test runner (rejected - adds complexity)

### Real-time Monitoring
**Decision**: FastAPI WebSocket endpoints + Server-Sent Events for dashboard updates  
**Rationale**: 
- Native FastAPI WebSocket support for real-time updates
- SSE for simple one-way dashboard updates 
- Integrates with existing OpenTelemetry for metrics collection
**Alternatives considered**: 
- Polling-based updates (rejected - not real-time)
- External monitoring service (rejected - adds dependency)

### GitHub Issues Integration
**Decision**: PyGithub library with GitHub REST API  
**Rationale**: 
- Well-maintained Python library for GitHub API
- Supports issue creation, labeling, and milestone assignment
- Authentication via GitHub App or personal access token
**Alternatives considered**: 
- GitHub CLI subprocess calls (rejected - less reliable)
- Direct REST API calls (rejected - more implementation overhead)

### Rate Limiting & Retry Strategy
**Decision**: tenacity library for exponential backoff + asyncio.Semaphore for concurrency control  
**Rationale**: 
- tenacity provides robust retry logic with exponential backoff
- asyncio.Semaphore limits concurrent requests to external services
- Configurable per-service rate limits
**Alternatives considered**: 
- Custom retry implementation (rejected - reinventing wheel)
- Circuit breaker pattern (deferred - can add later if needed)

### Dashboard Technology
**Decision**: FastAPI static file serving + vanilla JavaScript/HTML for testing dashboard  
**Rationale**: 
- Keeps technology stack simple and unified
- No additional build pipeline required
- FastAPI can serve static files alongside API endpoints
**Alternatives considered**: 
- React/Vue.js SPA (rejected - adds build complexity)
- Separate frontend framework (rejected - increases deployment complexity)

### Configuration Management
**Decision**: Pydantic Settings with environment variable overrides  
**Rationale**: 
- Type-safe configuration with validation
- Environment-specific overrides for different testing environments
- Integrates well with existing FastAPI patterns
**Alternatives considered**: 
- YAML configuration files (rejected - less type safety)
- Direct environment variable reading (rejected - no validation)

## Integration Patterns

### External Service Health Checks
**Pattern**: Async health check endpoints with timeout and retry logic
```python
# Pseudo-code pattern
async def check_service_health(service_config):
    try:
        response = await httpx.get(service_config.health_url, timeout=30)
        return {"status": "healthy", "latency": response.elapsed}
    except httpx.TimeoutException:
        return {"status": "timeout", "error": "Health check timed out"}
```

### Test Session Management
**Pattern**: Session-scoped test isolation with cleanup hooks
- Each test session gets isolated configuration
- Automatic cleanup of test data after session completion
- Session state tracking for progress monitoring

### Feedback Loop Implementation
**Pattern**: Event-driven feedback collection with async processing
- Real-time UI updates via WebSocket
- Async GitHub issue creation to avoid blocking UI
- Structured feedback data with categorization

## Security Considerations

### Credential Management
- Integration credentials stored in secure environment variables
- No credentials in logs or error messages
- Rotation capability for all external service credentials

### Test Data Isolation
- Dedicated test user accounts for external services
- Clear data boundaries between test and production
- Automated verification that no production data is accessed

### Access Control
- Testing dashboard accessible only to authorized users
- Rate limiting on feedback submission endpoints
- Audit logging for all testing activities

## Performance Considerations

### Async Operation Design
- All external service calls use async/await patterns
- Concurrent health checks with controlled parallelism
- Non-blocking feedback submission

### Resource Management
- Connection pooling for external HTTP calls
- Configurable timeout values per service type
- Memory-efficient logging with rotation

### Monitoring Integration
- OpenTelemetry spans for all external service calls
- Custom metrics for integration health and response times
- Dashboard performance metrics collection

## Implementation Notes

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for core logic components
- Integration tests against real external services (with test accounts)
- Contract tests for GitHub API interactions
- End-to-end tests for complete user workflows

### Deployment Considerations
- Environment-specific configuration for different test stages
- Docker container support for consistent environments
- Health check endpoints for deployment verification

### Observability
- Structured logging with correlation IDs
- Metrics for integration success/failure rates
- Distributed tracing for request flows across services
