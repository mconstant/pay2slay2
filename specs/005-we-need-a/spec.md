## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a product owner and manual tester, we need a fully functional testing environment where all system integrations are operational (non-dry run mode) so that we can validate the complete user experience, identify issues across integration points, and provide meaningful feedback to guide product development decisions.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a complete testing environment is deployed, **When** a manual tester performs end-to-end workflows, **Then** all integrations respond with real data and transactions are processed successfully
2. **Given** the testing environment is running, **When** the product owner reviews functionality, **Then** they can access comprehensive feedback mechanisms to document observations and issues
3. **Given** integration issues are discovered, **When** feedback is submitted, **Then** the development team receives actionable reports with sufficient detail to reproduce and fix problems
4. **Given** a testing session is completed, **When** stakeholders review results, **Then** they can make informed decisions about feature readiness and release criteria

### Edge Cases
- What happens when external integrations are temporarily unavailable during testing?
- How does the system handle rate limiting from third-party services during intensive testing?
- What occurs when test data conflicts with production-like constraints?
- How are integration failures differentiated from application bugs?

### UX Acceptance Criteria
- Testing dashboard provides clear status indicators for all integration health
- Feedback submission interface allows categorization of issues (integration, UX, performance, security)
- Test results are exportable in formats suitable for stakeholder review
- Real-time collaboration features enable immediate communication between testers and product owner
- Visual indicators clearly distinguish between dry-run simulation results and live integration responses

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST operate in non-dry run mode with all integrations actively processing real transactions
- **FR-002**: System MUST provide real-time status monitoring for all external integration endpoints
- **FR-003**: Manual testers MUST be able to execute complete user workflows that span multiple integrations
- **FR-004**: Product owner MUST be able to access comprehensive testing reports and integration health metrics
- **FR-005**: System MUST capture and log all integration requests, responses, and errors for debugging purposes
- **FR-006**: Feedback submission system MUST allow categorization and prioritization of discovered issues
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide rollback capabilities if critical issues are discovered during testing
- **FR-008**: All test data MUST be isolated from production systems while using real integration endpoints
- **FR-009**: System MUST validate integration response formats and data integrity in real-time
- **FR-010**: Testing environment MUST support 1 concurrent tester with dedicated session isolation
- **FR-011**: Feedback system MUST integrate with GitHub Issues for automated issue creation and tracking
- **FR-012**: System MUST handle integration rate limits and quotas using request queuing with exponential backoff retry strategy

### Key Entities
- **Testing Environment**: Represents the complete deployed system configuration with live integrations enabled for Yunite, Discord OAuth, Banano node, wallet services, and admin functions
- **Integration Endpoint**: External service connections that process real transactions and return live data from Yunite, Discord, Banano, wallet, and admin systems
- **Test Session**: A bounded period of collaborative testing with defined scope and participants
- **Feedback Report**: Structured documentation of issues, observations, and recommendations from testing activities
- **Integration Health Status**: Real-time monitoring data showing availability, response times, and error rates for each external service (Yunite, Discord, Banano, wallet, admin)

## Security Considerations *(mandatory)*
- Threat model summary: Testing environment handles real integration credentials and processes live transactions; actors include internal testers and product stakeholders; entry points include testing interfaces and integration endpoints
- Sensitive data handling: Integration API keys and credentials must be encrypted at rest and in transit; test data must not contain real user PII
- Secrets management: Integration credentials stored in secure configuration management with rotation capabilities
- Dependency and supply chain risks: All integration SDKs and testing tools must be verified and kept updated
- Abuse/misuse cases and mitigations: Rate limiting to prevent accidental DoS of external services; access controls to limit testing environment usage to authorized personnel
- Automation / AI Execution Constraints: Manual oversight required for all destructive operations; automated rollback triggers for critical integration failures; audit logging for all system modifications during testing

## Performance Targets
- Integration response monitoring: p95 latency alerts when external services exceed baseline by 200%
- Test environment availability: 99.5% uptime during scheduled testing windows
- Feedback submission latency: under 2 seconds for issue reporting interface
- Integration health check frequency: every 30 seconds with alerting on failures (extended timeout for Banano node due to slow startup)
- Integration health check response time: under 30 seconds maximum acceptable latency
- Test data isolation verification: real-time validation that no production data is accessed

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-30
- Q: How many concurrent testers should the testing environment support during peak testing sessions? ‚Üí A: 1 tester
- Q: Which project management or issue tracking tool should the feedback system integrate with? ‚Üí A: GitHub Issues (native repository integration)
- Q: How should the system handle integration rate limits and quotas from external services? ‚Üí A: Queue requests with exponential backoff retry
- Q: What specific external integrations need to be tested in this non-dry run environment? ‚Üí A: Yunite, Discord, Banano, wallet, admin
- Q: What is the maximum acceptable response time for integration health checks during testing? ‚Üí A: Under 30 seconds (relaxed monitoring) but banano node spins up slowly

## Decentralized Distribution / Blockchain Applicability

`N/A` - This feature focuses on testing environment setup and integration validation, which does not involve decentralized distribution mechanisms or blockchain components. The testing infrastructure operates in a traditional client-server architecture with external API integrations.
