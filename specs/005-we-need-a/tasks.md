# Tasks: Complete Non-Dry Run Testing Environment

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/005-we-need-a/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory
   → Extract: Python 3.13, FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, OpenTelemetry, pytest
   → Structure: Single project (src/, tests/)
2. Load design documents:
   → data-model.md: 6 entities (TestSession, IntegrationEndpoint, IntegrationHealthStatus, TestResult, FeedbackReport, FeedbackAttachment)
   → contracts/api.yaml: 8 main endpoints + WebSocket
   → quickstart.md: 5 test workflows (session creation, health monitoring, integration tests)
3. Generate tasks by category:
   → Setup: dependencies, linting, database
   → Tests: contract tests, integration tests (TDD)
   → Core: models, services, endpoints
   → Integration: GitHub API, WebSocket, monitoring
   → Polish: unit tests, performance, documentation
4. Apply task rules:
   → Different files = mark [P] for parallel
   → Tests before implementation (TDD)
   → Models before services before endpoints
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001-T035)
6. Constitutional compliance verified (security, observability, performance)
```

## Format: `[ID] [P?] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
Single project structure: `src/`, `tests/` at repository root

## Phase 3.1: Setup
- [ ] T001 Create testing module structure in src/testing/ with __init__.py
- [ ] T002 Add testing dependencies to pyproject.toml (tenacity, pygithub, websockets)
- [ ] T003 [P] Configure testing-specific linting rules in pyproject.toml
- [ ] T004 Create Alembic migration for testing tables in alembic/versions/

**Constitution Check Verification**
✅ Plan has PASS for Constitution Check with security, performance, observability requirements
✅ No decentralized/blockchain requirements apply (N/A per spec)
✅ AI autonomy guardrails specified for manual oversight

## Phase 3.2: Tests First (TDD) ⚠️ MUST COMPLETE BEFORE 3.3
**CRITICAL: These tests MUST be written and MUST FAIL before ANY implementation**

## Dependencies
- **Setup phase (T001-T004)** before all other phases
- **All tests (T005-T026)** before any implementation (T027+)
- **Models (T027-T032)** before services (T033-T036)
- **Services (T033-T036)** before endpoints (T037-T047)
- **Core endpoints (T037-T047)** before real-time features (T048-T050)
- **Implementation (T027-T050)** before integration (T051-T063)
- **Everything** before polish (T064-T075)

## Parallel Execution Examples

### Contract Tests (can run simultaneously)
```bash
# All contract tests are independent files
Task: "Contract test GET /testing/sessions in tests/contract/test_sessions_get.py"
Task: "Contract test POST /testing/sessions in tests/contract/test_sessions_post.py"
Task: "Contract test GET /testing/integrations in tests/contract/test_integrations_get.py"
Task: "Contract test POST /testing/feedback in tests/contract/test_feedback_post.py"
# ... (all T005-T015 can run in parallel)
```

### Data Models (can run simultaneously)
```bash
# All models are independent files
Task: "TestSession model in src/testing/models/test_session.py"
Task: "IntegrationEndpoint model in src/testing/models/integration_endpoint.py" 
Task: "FeedbackReport model in src/testing/models/feedback_report.py"
# ... (all T027-T032 can run in parallel)
```

### Service Layer (can run simultaneously)
```bash
# All services are independent files
Task: "TestSessionService CRUD operations in src/testing/services/test_session_service.py"
Task: "IntegrationService health checks in src/testing/services/integration_service.py"
Task: "FeedbackService with GitHub API in src/testing/services/feedback_service.py"
# ... (all T033-T036 can run in parallel)
```

## Notes
- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- API endpoints (T037-T047) are sequential as they modify shared router files
- Verify all tests fail before implementing corresponding features
- Commit after completing each task
- Real-time features (WebSocket, dashboard) require core endpoints to be complete
- External service clients can be developed in parallel once models/services exist

## Task Generation Rules Applied
1. **From Contracts**: 11 contract test tasks for API endpoints
2. **From Data Model**: 6 model creation tasks for entities  
3. **From User Stories**: 7 integration test tasks for workflows
4. **Security & Performance**: 4 specialized test tasks for requirements
5. **Dependencies**: Models → Services → Endpoints → Integration → Polish
6. **Parallel Marking**: All independent file tasks marked [P]
